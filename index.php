<p class="description">The first two projects involved groups of four to five students. I happened to be in the group with only four people, but the project turned out well in the end. I handled the CSS for Project 1, and I had to work around and expand upon the styles in the CSS framework. Project 1 was also my first time using Github. Not only did Github cause some problems early on, but it was difficult to coordinate the efforts of all four group members. However, we succeeded in our joint endeavor and produced a working website on time.</p>

<p class="description">The labs in this class were challenging, and it took me a great deal of time to work through most of them. Some of the earlier labs were a review of concepts learned in CSC 170, but as new concepts were added, they became much more difficult. Lab 7 was my favorite lab because adding web fonts to a page makes it more unique and demonstrates a higher level of creativity. Lab 11 was my least favorite because the back-end work on the web server was extremely frustrating and 99% of the time nothing worked. Wordpress was also unresponsive and unwieldy at times. This caused a substantial number of issues, such as the theme disappearing for good and the sidebar not showing up. Nonetheless, I think Wordpress is an good tool to use, and it has many cool features to play around with.</p>
